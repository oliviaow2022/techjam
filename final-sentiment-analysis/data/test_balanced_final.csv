"I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d, 31 waist, 38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said, even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first, it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back, get all four panels even, tied, hiding my bra, etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga, i may not have managed. once on, the style looked great. as"
"The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however, the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :("
I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c
The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.
"This skirt is very pretty, but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized, so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements, there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips."
I wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes. not worth the price. poorly made. you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin. the shirt looks better int he picture. i like it but it wears terribly.
"I ordered the black & white, 00 petite. i'm 5' 2"", 96 lbs. and i order petite sizes all the time. the length for the size i ordered is about 23"" (on the back, from neckline) which is great for me; however, the length on the sides is way too short. the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25"", so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans. not at all the way it shows on the model. i would order 00, regular length, but then the sleeves will b"
"I've been wearing these shorts for years, i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure, they're great when you try them on in the store..soft, comfortable, flattering, but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times, sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall, and a"
"Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux."
This is a darling white top. the juxtaposition of the simple front and the beautiful lace back makes this a unique piece. definitely size down.
"This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me."
"Thought i would love this product, but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try."
These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.
"If you're pregnant, congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs, this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d, normally a small or medium, but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me, although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides, it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve, which makes it look wide at the to"
"I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts, length is fine...the inside is some, but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back."
"This dress is gourgeous, will be able to wear year round. just add a cardigan or blazer. the only fault i find in it is the waist band is a bit wide. however i have a hour glass shape, so my waist is very small"
I read the previous comments and was skeptical. i love the dress! it's fitted on the top and flowy on the bottom. i didn't find it too big or maternity on the bottom half. the print is really pretty with flecks of blue that brightened up the dress.
"I really, really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately, i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6"", but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)"
"This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer, i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4"", usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash."
"I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful, and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well, which is not a given for this style top, and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions, and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length, not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried a size s."
"Unfortunately, this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also, the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust."
"I was sorry to miss the original offering of this dress when it went on sale, so i jumped and ordered the gray/blue/green/black stripes when offered. i purchase almost all of my retailer clothes online, the dresses i am interested in are not generally offered in my local store, so there is always that moment of truth when i get to find out if something i fell in love with actually works for me... as everyone else has said, this dress is fabulous! i got my usual size 10. i am 5'5, small busted and"
"Beautiful dress but the fit was off for me. overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail. as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute. i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top. i'm 5'6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small, the top just hung off of me. perhaps it would have been better with an xs."
"This is a lovely top. received many compliments. felt very feminine, and perfect for chilly spring. please take this to the dry cleaners, you will avoid feeling distraught as i did after washing it, which is the recommended method to clean it, and seeing it shrunk to half it's previous size. sad."
This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
"This dress ran large on me. i am a 10, sometimes an 8 but went with the 10. it just hung on me, giving me no shape. the colors are pretty and the dress was nice, but i expected it to wow me more for the price. sending back, may try again if the next size makes it to sale."
I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.
"I own the essential slims and love them, so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t"
"I was expecting this to be longer. nothing wrong with it, i will be returning it because it was a little short."
"If i could tell you how many compliments i got on with this coat, i would end up writing a book. this coat is beautiful, fits like a glove. i got the size 4, went into the store to try it on to make sure it fit right and tried on both the 4 and 6. i'm typically a 2, so i guess i went a size up. this coat is striking and the colors are beautiful."
"This dress is very good quality, with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting, but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately, when i put it on and looked in the mirror, i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and, combined with the overall design and length, i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit"
I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7
"I tried the red/salmon color on at the store. it's a very bright color, but a nice one. the top is form-fitting, with soft stretchy material. there are two small buttons at each shoulder. the sleeves are a good length. the boatneck shows a little bit of bra strap, but not too noticeable. the only thing i didn't care for was the somewhat synthetic look of the material. if you're between sizes, size up as it's a snug fit."
"I want to love this dress. the colors and pattern are gorgeous, and i love the hemline. but something seems off in the chest and shoulders area. it almost feels a little slouch-y."
"I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews"
I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.
"I purchased this dress in the red color. overall quality is excellent. the zipper was a little hard to work because the lace kept getting caught in it. the neckline was also too high. i'm 5'1"" and 107lbs. the dress fit perfectly. there is was too much nude fabric showing through the dress. i feel that this dress isn't versatile. to me this is somethings that would be great for weddings or bridal/baby showers. due to the lack of versatility and the fact that i wasn't in love with it, i returned"
"Just received these and they fit perfectly, but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise, but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning"
So comfortable and warm! so nice to lounge in a cold day and be cute!
"I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1"" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as ""runs large"" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo"
"I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure, but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short."
"I wanted this romper so bad, after buying (and loving) a shirt from madewell made with the same fabric earlier this year. i wish this romper was just a little bit longer and roomier. i normally wear a size 10 or 12 and bought the large. it fit me ok but i felt like i wanted it to be just a little bit more oversized around my hips and definitely wanted it to be longer in the legs. (retailer please stop with the capri lengths! it's tired!!) if you are narrow-hipped you will fare much better. the fab"
"Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist, and it was still too short for me. :-("
"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms, all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra"
"I **love** this dress. it's definitely an investment, but well worth the price! i get so many compliments on it every time i wear it, and it can definitely be dressed up or down for casual or formal events."
"Ref: 5'4"", 125# 27/4, 32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order."
"I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi"
This is very large. i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x. it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.

"I almost ordered this dress yesterday online but did not. i went into my local retailer today and they had it in stock. tried it and completely fell in love with it and even my retailer lady in the back was amazed! i am 5""5"", 115lbs. and went with the xs petite. excellent price point. gorgeous in ""neutral"".... tts highly recommend!"
"I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me. (strange because although i am not petite, i am fairly short wasted.) i also wasn't in love with the neckline. i will continue my search for a weekend-w"
"I was so excited to see this on sale, with an extra 25% off! no brainer. i bought the cream color which is the most beautiful sand color. just as shown. it is super soft and thin. a good quality thin knit. it's just too long for me. it just doesn't quite look right on me. i still have to give it a high rating because it is truly exactly as pictured. i'm 5'9 and it hits just above my knees and the slit runs up to my belt. if i could knock 3inches off this i'd have it in every color."
"I loved this top when i saw it online, and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately, the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small, and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest, i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top, but it just won't work for me."
"This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical, fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all, and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for ""ironic"", it would be difficult to"
"Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo). sadly, it's going back."
"I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted, but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through. fit is tts."
I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.
"I don't normally write reviews, but this shirt was so terrible, that i felt inspired. first off, the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly, there is no shape whatsoever, unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall, this shirt is an insult to the female form. retailer, what is with all of these shapeless, frocks in cheap f"
"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality."
Great dress for vacations!
"Soft fabric, the blue is a nice color, rich. the drape effect is very flattering on the body. the length of the regular xs was fine on me, i often get petite but would not need it in this case. could wear this with jeans or dress it up with a nice skirt. good basic."
I love this dress but when i put it on i was aghast! the chest was tight and the body was voluminous!! added the pounds which no wants! best left to the waify girls.
"I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived, however, they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly, the pants are, in actuality, quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height, if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly, the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown, although the width of the pant legs may have"
Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.
"Tried it on in store and had to have it. so soft and easy to throw on. i'm 5'6"" and it hits at the knee. i usually wear an xs or small in tops and the xs fit great."
"Dress is pretty, i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep, i am returning. :("
"I wanted something for the hot summers here, and this fits the ticket. very lightweight and airy. it's somewhat of a strange design, short in the front, hitting an inch or two above the knee, but the back is unusually long. the lining is awkward, and kind of tight and difficult to get into. the material is very thin, and although i haven't noticed any strings or unraveling like other reviewers, it's not the highest quality. overall the dress is nice and lightweight, but not the greatest quality"
"I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down 2 sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 12 but still acceptabl"
This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!
"Despite retailer's claim that they have ""fixed"" the button issue on this coat, beware. they haven't. i ordered this coat november 18th, feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed, because retailer indicated ""rest assured, this issue has been fixed"" (as noted in the item description). feeling confident that i'd get a non-defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle, i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight (nov 24th) immediately di"
"I love these leggings - they look and feel great, but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband, so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out, for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style, comfort, and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active."
"I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly. and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back."
"This dress was very cute the first time i wore it, but after my second wear, the bottom layer didn't remain adjacent to the top layer and i found it to be awkward."
"This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however, if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c), the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well."
Dress just did not fit will around the hips. also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off. looks like someone may have wore it and returned it. was not flattering at all.
""
The shirts fits well. it is very soft and stretchy but thick enough that it's not see through. the collar is the best part. i wear small and i'm 5'3.
"This dress is more beautiful in person. this dress fits well on top for my broad shoulders, chest(40c)and through my straight hips. note. the side bottom panels are very stretchy. i will have it tailored slimmer. so if you are bottom curvy, this dress is awesome!"
This is my new favorite shirt!! you can dress it up or down. so comfy and totally flattering :)
"I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version, but it just didn't work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale. i tried on the small and the extra small - didn't notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo."
"I had this in my cart for ages, waiting for a sale and debating the dress in general. i am delighted as it did finally go on sale, i bought it, and it is fabulous!!! my measurements are 36/28/39, i wear a 34d bra, and the small fit perfectly. the only problem i have had with it is that the lining in the front shows about 3/8"" at the bottom of the dress once i have worn the dress. what seems to happen is that the dress creeps up due to its wrinkling, but the lining does not, hence the showing. i"
Ordered med petite. love the print & design but it runs really big more like a large and length of top is not flattering . returning
"I have athletic calves from running, so i really struggle with straight/skinny jeans. but these fit me just fine (and don't look like jeggings). i think the slit helps. i have a 29"" inseam and these hit just above the ankle. great find - especially on sale."
Top is well made. runs large the arm holes were too big and sagged under my arms showing my bra. go a size smaller than your normal size.
"While i love the design and shape of this blouse, the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it."
Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
"This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of, it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape."
"I didn't notice this dress online but it jumped out at me at the store. i sized down to a small as the bust and arm area seemed very loose in medium. (36b). it's very comfy and beautiful. i tried it with a belt, but quite honestly it doesn't need one and it looks so much nicer without one. not sure about what bra to wear ...likely strapless , or as one person said. .none."
"This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5"" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p."
"I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one. my usual is 0 or 2, sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft, adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere, and i am a bit braod for my size. i deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month *multiple purcahses) and this was one of 2 i had to pick... if it goes on sal"
"The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist, but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s, and i could have sized down 1, maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size."
Runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small.
This dress is super cute and sexy. i bought the taupe in a size medium. for reference i'm tall (5'11) and weigh about 152. i don't know how tall the last reviewer is but this was not too short in the front for me. i really like it.
"When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial but the outer gauze layer is thin."
"Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons: it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock,under my arm, which could be seen, i guess, if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos! next, who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea? if i had gotten a nice patterned top, i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b"
"I love the pattern (red motif) but the sizing of this dress is way off. the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart. the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"", 170# bra size 34f and 40-41"" hips."
"I'm curvy, and i often have trouble finding pants that don't have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome, especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips, so if you're trying to hide hips, these aren't for you. i love them, though--they drape beautifully and feel great."
