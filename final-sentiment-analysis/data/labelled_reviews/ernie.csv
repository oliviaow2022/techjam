I found it hard to pair with bottoms. fit wasn't very flattering for me.,negative,0.9091797471046448
I love this brand and the 8 fits perfect. i am typically an 8 in retailer skirts and this is no exception. medium to heavy weight soft denim which is more of a darker denim shade with a wide a-line cut. the pockets are distinct and give the skirt character. it is pretty long and full looking on my 5'4 inch height. i purchased this on sale plus promo and very happy i was able to receive it as it became a sold out style in my size. the hem is a wide stitch hem and gives it a nice look. i look forwar,positive,0.9663641452789307
"The color, design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected, but as the owner of several deletta brand tops, i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes, and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large. bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s",positive,0.5060257315635681
I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.,negative,0.9456836581230164
"On me, this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9, 34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly, for the price and fit, i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.",negative,0.9874038100242615
"Nicely made, pretty details, but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!",positive,0.978756844997406

"This is a lovely blouse. i think is a bit roomy, but even so, i like the look. i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as it's not too casual.",positive,0.9576852321624756
"This skirt looks great on, i didn't even think before buying it, planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design, not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates, it is not sewn in or built to last. then, it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it, but they said they would have to resew the whole garment, not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran",positive,0.9709545969963074
"This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased",positive,0.9715079069137573
"I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5"" and 120 lbs and the small is just right.",positive,0.9797375202178955
"I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it.",negative,0.9025231003761292
"I thought this top had shimmery dots, that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived, it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.",negative,0.9054063558578491
"Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however, the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.",negative,0.8744776248931885
"This top looks just like you see it on the website - design is super cool and color is awesome, almost acid washed in areas. but know that this top is super, super thin and will not provide any warmth. i wish it were a bit thicker in fabric, it would have been perfect for the cool fall and going into winter especially for the price. the medium in this one fit me better than the small. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.",positive,0.8657829761505127
I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.,negative,0.979619026184082
"I ordered this top in 2 colors because i thought it would be great with leggings. i always love my retailer purchases, but this fell a little short. i think it may be the type fabric it is, but the way the back hangs so low on my frame (5'4"") it doesn't drape nicely over my leggings. the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans, it would be ok. i returned them both to the store. this is one that would be better to try on first...",negative,0.8189094066619873
"I ordered this online and the colors are prettier in person. the blue and gray contrast nicely and have a beautiful sheen to them. i am usually a 2 at retailer and while that fit, i felt i could size down. i am slender and since it is a shift, there was little room in the waist/butt area. i ordered a 0 and that fit perfect! if you love blue (like i do), this dress is for you!",positive,0.9823492169380188

"Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.",negative,0.9647172689437866
These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store.,positive,0.966457188129425
These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.,positive,0.7594125866889954
"This dress is even better in person than in the photos online. the colors are vibrant, the material has a nice, warm weight to it, and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special. i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons, as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it didn't fall off. the dress does run a little small, i think - i normally am an extra small, but the small fit me very well.",positive,0.9810434579849243
"I just received these in the mail, but had to send them back to the store because they are too big. i usually wear a 28 and sometimes even a 29 in most ag and mother jeans. the 28 in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture. i ordered size 27, so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute. the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown.",negative,0.5707527995109558
"Awesome pants. they look a lot better in person than in these pictures. i got it in dark blue. they are very comfortable, and can be used day to night. if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option. it's a bit more dressy than other models, still look casual and fun. i may end up getting a couple more for myself...",positive,0.9922561049461365
"Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.",negative,0.9909839034080505
Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).,negative,0.6270427107810974
"This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders, which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great, modest and cute swimsuit.",positive,0.9844274520874023
"It's not often you can find a dress that is warm, cozy, timeless, and sexy at the same time, but this one is it. the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places. i normally wear an xs or s, and in this i took an xs. sleeves are nice and long. your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be, depending on how low you fold over the collar piece. i chose to tack mine down in place, so i'm not always adjusting it. i wore this dress with black heeled over-the-knee boots",positive,0.9789390563964844
"I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it's very large! i normally take a large in retailer, but i can't figure out my size in this. it's very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is.",positive,0.6193315982818604
"First, this vest is made by elevenses. i love this menswear inspired vest. it's simple and structured, however, it's long on my 5'2 frame. the price is also a little steep, but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit. i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom.",positive,0.9898064136505127
"I saw army green pants similar to this in the store, but then found these on line and ordered them instead. i love them. they stretch out a bit so i am glad i sized down. i could possibly have sized down even one more size. i got a 27. the waist is very comfortable, so maybe this is just the fit...after all, they are basically stylish fatiques. either way, they are casual but on trend. i have planned a ton of outfits in my head already because these pants will go with so much! i think the cuff w",positive,0.991337776184082
"Love this chemise. the lace detail is cute, the length of the skirt is longer than many of the night gowns you'd find in the cute, not frumpy category, and overall it is super soft and comfortable for lounging and sleeping. bought the large, and i'm normally around a size 8-10, between medium and large depending on the cut of the item. the large is slightly on the big size, so the straps move around when i sleep. not a big deal for me, so i kept it.",positive,0.9829708337783813
"It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me. i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite, i'd try it. it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy.",positive,0.5604490637779236
"True to form, this retailer sweater hits the mark! it's light weight, stylish, great for a shorter person like myself, and has cute detailing. the sleeves are little long, but i push them up anyway and the cream color i bought goes with everything. the xs size is more comfortable and flattering than the s if you are short. i would have bought the bluish gray color of this sweater, too, but already own a similarly shaded and textured sweater from retailer from last year...love that one,",positive,0.9974223971366882
I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.,negative,0.9940934181213379

This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.,positive,0.745559811592102
This is a nice top but it runs very large. the small was still too large for me. hoping they have this in xs.,positive,0.9747548699378967
"This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy, and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price, but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos, but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.",positive,0.7237808108329773
"Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5'9""). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i've tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can",positive,0.9768933653831482
"I'm always nervous about length on ponchos, and this one was perfect (fit like the model and i am 5'7""). it is definitely a thin/semi-sheer knit, but it looks so classy and elegant with a black long sleeve under it and jeans. i love that this doesn't require dry cleaning and makes me look put-together for an easy day to night look. i'm 25 weeks pregnant and love that this works now and later :) very happy with this purchase!",positive,0.9876145124435425
"I love maeve tops. i love the material and feel of this brand. when i saw the new tops that came out i ran to my local store to try one on. i'm usually a large in a top, once in a while an xl. they only had a large to try so i tried it in the black motif. i could barely get the top on. it looked like i was missing 1/2 of the top. i doubled checked the size and it was a large. it's a shame, the top is really cute. if you are the least bit broad or busty, go up a size or two. if you are usually a",negative,0.47232240438461304

"This appears much more pink in person. i'm not really a pink girl but thought i'd try. the way the shoulders are cut makes my defined shoulders/arms look too intense for my liking. this would look nicer on someone more petite and less athletic in my opinion. i like that the bust has slight padding that can make a bra unnecessary for yoga, spin, pilates, ballet, or barre class. it's nice and fitted and true to size. would be really cute on the right person.",positive,0.9174606800079346
I had high hopes for this top but it was too big and too much fabric.,negative,0.948569118976593
"This dress is adorable in the photo; however, in reality, it fits like a tent. the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it. it flares out in the skirt to become an a-line and it's just not very flattering. if i had read the reviews before ordering, i would have sized down, but i ordered before any reviews had been posted. sadly, i must return.",negative,0.8367273211479187

"I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer, and this is not it. like others, it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps, but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do. - the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however,",negative,0.9106672406196594

"I tried this dress on in the store, prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer, it would look more proportionate. next, the tie is really difficult to place, but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily, i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined, what a bummer, at least the skirt could be lined. but, it does have pockets, that is sweet.",positive,0.8981564044952393
This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.,positive,0.9390468001365662

I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.,positive,0.5198385119438171
